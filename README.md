Files named NGCXXXX_Pop_Mag.csv contain the positions, S-PLUS magnitudes, Gaia magnitudes, Gaia proper motions and paralax as well as the classification of population 0 or 1 according to Hartmann et al. 2022. All columns are identified in the first line of each file.

Files named NGCXXXX_GDR3_SPLUS_SoS.csv3 are coma separated values containing the positions, S-PLUS magnitudes, Gaia magnitudes, Gaia proper motions, paralax and radial velocities, classification in pop 0 or 1. It also includes all information from the 'Survey of Surveys' (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/2022A%26A...659A..95T).

Files named NGCXXXX_GDR3_SPLUS_SoS.vot are the same as .csv3 but in VOT format.

File NGC104_GDR3_SPLUS_SoS_XY.csv is the same as files NGCXXXX_GDR3_SPLUS_SoS.csv with added (X,Y) and (Vx,Vy) according to van den Ven et al (2006) and Gaia Colab. (2018) A12. (X,Y) coordinates are in arcsec and (Vx,Vy) is in mas/yr.
